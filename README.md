# Who am I?

Interactive Frontend Development Project - Code Institute

Who am I? is a guessing game similar to 20Q. A celebrity name is picked at random by the computer and the goal of the user is to guess the name correctly.
The user has ten questions to ask. For each question, they have an option of three questoins to ask. They can guess at any time. The game is designed so that by the end, it should be obvious to who the celebrity is.

A live version can be found [Here](https://dmongey101.github.io/Who-am-I/).

## UX

The design of the game is very simple. When a player submits a question that question is locekd on the screen so they may not go back and change the question. 
A modal is used to tell the player whether or not they are correct and allows them to try again or to check the answer. 

### No Template was used

User requirements are met in the following ways:

* When a user clicks on the dropdown, they are given 3 random questions to choose from. 
* When a user submits their question, the question and answer are printed on the screen.
* When a user submits an guess, an appropriate modal is triggered.

### Wireframing
    
Wireframes were made on pen and paper.
